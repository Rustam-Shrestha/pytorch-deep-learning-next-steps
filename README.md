# Water Potability Prediction: PyTorch Workflow Summary

This document outlines the key concepts and architecture used to build a binary classification model for predicting water potability using PyTorch. It covers data handling with `Dataset` and `DataLoader`, model definition using object-oriented programming (OOP), and activation strategies for training and inference.

---

## 1. Data Preparation with PyTorch Dataset

In PyTorch, custom datasets are created by subclassing `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. This allows flexible loading and preprocessing of data from external sources like CSV files.

### Required Methods in a PyTorch Dataset

PyTorch expects every custom dataset to implement three core methods:

- `__init__()`  
  Loads the data from a file (e.g., CSV) and stores it in memory. This is where preprocessing or conversion to NumPy arrays typically happens.

- `__len__()`  
  Returns the total number of samples in the dataset. This helps PyTorch iterate over the dataset correctly.

- `__getitem__(idx)`  
  Retrieves a single sample at the given index. It returns a tuple of `(features, label)` where:
  - `features` are all columns except the last one.
  - `label` is the last column, representing the target variable (potability).

This structure ensures that each sample is accessible and formatted correctly for training.

## 2. DataLoader: Batching and Shuffling

Once the dataset is defined, it is wrapped in a `DataLoader`. The DataLoader handles:

- **Batching**: Groups samples into batches for efficient training.
- **Shuffling**: Randomizes the order of samples to prevent learning order bias.
- **Iteration**: Provides an iterable interface to loop through batches during training.

This abstraction simplifies the training loop and ensures consistent data feeding into the model.

---

## 3. Model Architecture: Object-Oriented Approach

Instead of using `nn.Sequential`, the model is defined using a class-based approach by subclassing `nn.Module`. This OOP method provides greater flexibility and clarity.

### Key Components of the Model Class

- `__init__()`  
  This method defines the layers of the model. For the water potability task, the model includes:
  - Three fully connected (`Linear`) layers
  - Two ReLU activation functions for hidden layers
  - One Sigmoid activation for the output layer (suitable for binary classification)

- `forward(x)`  
  This method defines the forward pass — how input data flows through the layers. It applies the activations between layers and returns the final output.

### Why Use OOP for Model Definition?

- **Modularity**: Each layer and operation is clearly defined and reusable.
- **Flexibility**: Easier to add custom logic, conditional flows, or debugging hooks.
- **Scalability**: Supports complex architectures like CNNs, RNNs, or attention mechanisms.

This approach is preferred for production-grade models and research workflows.

## 4. Activation Functions and Output Strategy

Activation functions shape how the model learns and transforms data:

- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**  
  Used in hidden layers to introduce non-linearity and preserve gradients. It helps avoid vanishing gradient problems.

- **Sigmoid**  
  Used in the output layer for binary classification. It squashes output to a range between 0 and 1, representing probability of potability.

Choosing the right activation function is critical for stable and interpretable learning.

## 5. Training Workflow Summary

| Component       | Purpose                                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Dataset         | Loads and formats raw data                   |
| DataLoader      | Batches and shuffles data for training       |
| Model Class     | Defines architecture and forward logic       |
| ReLU Activation | Enables gradient flow in hidden layers       |
| Sigmoid Output  | Converts final output to probability         |

## 6. Final Notes

- This workflow is modular and scalable — ideal for experimentation and deployment.
- Using OOP for model definition improves readability and control.
- Proper data handling via Dataset and DataLoader ensures robustness and reproducibility.
- Activation functions must be chosen based on task type and layer position.

This setup forms the foundation for building reliable deep learning models in PyTorch, especially for structured data tasks like water potability prediction.

# Day Summary: Optimizers, Training Loop, and Gradient Stability in PyTorch

This document outlines the key components implemented and understood during today's deep learning practice session using PyTorch. It covers model training, evaluation, and techniques to ensure gradient stability in neural networks.

## 1. Model Training and Evaluation Workflow

With the training loop fully implemented, the model (`net`) was successfully trained for **1000 epochs**. The training process included:

- Defining a custom PyTorch `Dataset` for water potability data
- Creating `DataLoader` objects for both training and test sets
- Initializing the model with proper architecture and activation functions
- Using the **Adam optimizer** for adaptive learning
- Applying **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)** as the loss function

### Evaluation Setup

After training, the model was evaluated using a separate `test_dataloader`, structured identically to the training loader but sourced from test data. The evaluation loop included:

- Switching the model to evaluation mode (`model.eval()`)
- Disabling gradient tracking (`torch.no_grad()`)
- Performing forward passes on test batches
- Applying a threshold of 0.5 to convert predicted probabilities to binary labels
- Computing the overall accuracy score using `torchmetrics.Accuracy`

This workflow ensures reproducibility, modularity, and clarity in both training and evaluation phases.

## 2. Gradient Stability in Neural Networks

Deep networks often suffer from **vanishing** or **exploding gradients**, which hinder effective learning. These issues were addressed through a structured three-part solution:

### A. Kaiming (He) Initialization

- Applied to all linear layers to preserve variance across layers
- Tailored for ReLU and similar activation functions
- Ensures stable gradient flow during backpropagation

### B. Activation Functions

- **ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)** was used instead of ReLU to avoid the dying neuron problem
- ELU maintains non-zero gradients for negative inputs and has a mean output near zero
- This choice improves gradient flow and model robustness

### C. Batch Normalization

- Added after each linear layer to normalize outputs
- Stabilizes the distribution of activations across batches
- Learns scale and shift parameters to optimize input distributions dynamically
- Accelerates convergence and reduces sensitivity to initialization and learning rate
